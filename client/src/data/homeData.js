      question: 'What is co-processing in cement kilns?',
      answer:
        'Co-processing is an environmentally sound method of waste management where non-recyclable waste is used as alternative fuel or raw material in cement manufacturing. The high temperatures in cement kilns (above 1400\u00b0C) ensure complete destruction of waste with minimal emissions, making it a sustainable solution for waste disposal.',
